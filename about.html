<h1>Hi, I'm Erin</h1>
<p>Welcome to my blog. This blog was started during my time learning at Flatiron School.
After taking a few classes here and there, I committed to the Web Development Immersive.
Though most of the posts at this time are focused on my journey through this Immersive,
as time goes on I look forward to branching into open-source projects, personal projects,
and other topics.</p>
